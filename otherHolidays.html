  <a id="Lore"></a><p><h3>Tomb Sweeping Day</b></h3>
  
  <p>Located on the 5th day of the fourth lunar month, Tomb Sweeping Day (Qing Ming in Chinese) is a day when people visit the graves of deceased relatives and keep the graves in order. It is a holiday to practice ancestral respect.  However, the name Qing Ming also translates to "Pure Brightness," which suggests that it also is a day for people to enjoy the budding spring while they are visiting their family members' graves</p>


<a id="Traditions"></a><h3>Qi Xi Day</h3>

<p>On the 7th day of the seventh lunar month and equivalent to Valentine's Day, Qi Xi commemorates the legend of the earthly cowherd (represented by the star Altair) and the celestrial weaver girl (represented by the star Vega).  While visiting earth, the celestial weaver girl, a daughter of the Jade Emperor, fell in love with the cowherd.  To meet the exhortations of the cowherd's boss, the weaver weaved divine tapestries to satisfy the boss as payment.  The cowherd and the weaver's lived happily together on earth for several years.  However, as she is a goddess, their love was not allowed.  When the Jade Emperor found out, he forced the weaver girl to return to the heavens, where one day in heaven is equivalent to one year on Earth. </p>

<p>The magpies, out of pity for the lovers, form a bridge with their bodies every earth year between the heavens and earth, so that the couple could meet in the middle of the bridge.  If it rains on Qi Xi Day, it is said that the magpies were not able to form a bridge that year, and the rain was caused by the tears of the separated lovers.</p>


</h3><a id="Food"></a><h3>Double Ninth</h3>
<p>Occuring on the 9th day of the ninth lunar month, the Double Ninth Day came about because in Taoism, the number nine is associated with "yang," a positive and forceful energy. To offset the increase in "yang" brought about by the two nines in the date, people climb mountains to spend their extra energy and drink chrysanthemum tea.</p>
