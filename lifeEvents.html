  <a id="Lore"></a><p><h3>Baby's First Month</b></h3>
  
  <p>In Asia, the day the baby reaches their first full month of life is significant, as this signifies that the baby has survived the most vulnerable time.  The day's significance is equivalent to a baby shower in the United States.  People celebrate by eating red eggs.  The mother is also given "oily rice"--a fried rice consisting of mushrooms, meat--to eat.</p>


<a id="Traditions"></a><h3>Birthdays</h3>

<p>It is traditional to eat noodles, called "Longevity Noodles," on one's birthday, as the long length of the noodles symbolize a long life. People also eat buns which are made to look like peaches (the buns are white with an indentation down the middle like peaches, with the tops dusted pink), as peaches are also a symbol of longevity</p>

<p>It is taboo to give a clock as a birthday gift.  In Chinese, the word for "Clock" sounds like the word for "Final," or in other words, Death.</p>

</h3><a id="Food"></a><h3>Weddings</h3>
<p>Instead of a church ceremony, the families of the bride and groom would throw a gigantic banquet (basically, skip right to the reception, but the reception is a grand. multi-course feast). During the banquet, besides wearing the white wedding gown, the bride will also change into several other formal ballgowns and parade them for the guests to see.  Lastly, the bride will wear a qipao, a slim fitting traditional Chinese gown as a nod to the Chinese heritage.  At the end of the banquet, the bride and groom greet each guest by the door as they leave; in this process, the bride holds a tray of candies and other goodies for the guests to partake, while the guests give back Red Envelopes full of money as gifts to the new couple.</p>
